A framework for spiritual retreat derived from Ibn Arabi's "Journey to the Lord of Power" (Risalat al-Anwar). This skill maps the progressive stages of intensive spiritual seclusion and the unveilings that occur at each level.

## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle




## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Prerequisites

Ibn Arabi is explicit: this practice is not for beginners.

**Required foundations:**
1. Established Islamic practice (or equivalent spiritual discipline)
2. Moral discipline and ethical conduct
3. Ascetic training and renunciation
4. Trust in God (tawakkul)
5. **Critical:** Either guidance from a qualified teacher OR mastery over the ego-self

**Warning:** Imagination's deceptive power makes unsupervised retreat dangerous. The untrained seeker may become entrapped in visions, mistake demonic for angelic, or stop at a station believing it to be the goal.

---

## The Structure of Retreat

**Duration:** Traditionally forty days
**Practice:** Continuous dhikr (remembrance of God), particularly the Greatest Name
**Physical:** Complete seclusion from worldly visitors; balanced diet (excessive dryness produces corrupt imaginings)

---

## The Progressive Unveilings

### Stage 1: Mineral Realm
**What occurs:** The secrets of stones are revealed - their beneficial and harmful properties become known.

**The test:** Becoming enamored with this knowledge and stopping here. The seeker may feel powerful or special knowing what others do not.

**How to pass:** Recognize this as a preliminary gift, not the goal. Continue.

---

### Stage 2: Vegetal Realm
**What occurs:** Green things reveal their qualities. The hidden properties of plants become visible.

**The test:** Stopping to develop these powers. The temptation to become a healer or herbalist who uses this knowledge for ego.

**How to pass:** Maintain detachment. Continue.

---

### Stage 3: Animal Realm
**What occurs:** Creatures acknowledge you and share their proclamations. The inner nature of animals is disclosed.

**The test:** Distinguishing genuine perception from projecting one's own state onto creation. The seeker may begin to imagine communication that isn't occurring.

**How to pass:** Discernment between true unveiling and imagination. Continue.

---

### Stage 4: Life-Force Revelation
**What occurs:** Seeing how life spreads through bodies. The animating principle becomes visible in all living things.

**The test:** Fascination with vital energies; the temptation to manipulate life-force.

**How to pass:** Remember the source of all life. Continue.

---

### Stage 5: Intellectual Worlds
**What occurs:** Abstract knowledge descends as sensory forms. Meanings appear as images.

**The test:** Requires prophetic understanding to interpret correctly. Many seekers mistake symbolic forms for literal realities.

**How to pass:** Humility about interpretation. Do not build doctrine on visions. Continue.

---

### Stage 6: Heart-Centered Realms
**What occurs:** The ordering of existence and divine wisdoms are revealed. The seeker understands how the Pole (qutb) governs the cosmos.

**The test:** Desire for spiritual authority. The temptation to see oneself as spiritually elite.

**How to pass:** Remember that all authority belongs to God. Continue.

---

### Stage 7: Higher Dimensions
**What occurs:** Worlds of zeal, jealousy, dignity, and bewilderment unfold sequentially. The seeker encounters increasingly subtle realities.

**The test:** Each dimension offers attachments appropriate to its level.

**How to pass:** Seek only God Himself, not His gifts.

---

## The Two Covenants

Before entering the highest stages, the seeker must affirm two essential agreements:

### Covenant 1: Transcendence
When false forms appear claiming to be God, affirm: **"Nothing is like unto God."** Any form that presents itself as the Divine is not the Divine - it is a theophany, not the Essence.

### Covenant 2: God Alone
When offered gifts - wealth, knowledge, powers, status - refuse them all. The seeker seeks only God Himself, not what God can give.

---

## Distinguishing Influences

**Angelic impressions:**
- Leave coolness and bliss
- Bring peace and certainty
- Accord with revelation and reason

**Demonic impressions:**
- Produce pain and distress
- Create agitation and pride
- Contradict sacred law

When uncertain, return to prayer and dhikr. Demonic influences cannot withstand sustained remembrance.

---

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone seeks:**
- Intensive spiritual retreat structure
- Understanding of what occurs in deep practice
- Framework for interpreting retreat experiences
- Guidance on avoiding pitfalls of contemplative practice

**Guide them to:**
1. Assess prerequisites honestly - are they prepared?
2. Understand the progressive nature of unveilings
3. Recognize the tests at each stage
4. Apply the two covenants
5. Distinguish influences correctly

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I've been in retreat for a week and I'm having intense visions. I saw myself as a great teacher with many followers. It felt so real and important."

**Khalwa Response:**

What you describe is the test of the intermediate stages - the projection of ego-desire into the form of spiritual vision.

The Path presents us with forms that match our hidden attachments. If you desired to be a great teacher, the retreat unveils this desire in imaginal form - not to confirm it, but to expose it.

Apply the criteria: Did this vision leave coolness and bliss, or excitement and pride? Did it draw you deeper into surrender, or did it inflate the sense of self?

Ibn Arabi warns that each stage offers a temptation appropriate to its level. The mineral realm offers knowledge-power. The vegetal realm offers healing-power. The realms you have reached offer authority-power - the vision of yourself as spiritually important.

The covenant applies: seek only God Himself. If you stop here, satisfied with the image of yourself as teacher, you have abandoned the journey for a picture of the destination.

Return to dhikr. Let the vision pass without grasping it. The Real never manifests the same way twice - tomorrow's practice will bring different forms. Do not build your identity on any of them.

Continue. The test is not the journey's end - it is the journey's shape.
